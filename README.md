# N2_TERP_Laser
Repository for the construction and operation of a Transversely Excited at Reduced Pressures (TERP) Nitrogen Laser. Its purpose, other than the fun of building it, will be to pump dye lasers.

## Details
The laser is designed to be operated with nitrogen at around 100mbar (75torr) absolute pressure, a 10mm electrode gap and 10-15kV. The spark gap is adjustable, but works with about 1 mm electrode spacing with a 2 bar (3bar absolute) N2 filling. An adjustable UV-Mirror increases (~2x) the output power. The three doorknob caps have about 800pF each, and the secondary capacitor (formed by the copper plate and the mylar foil) has around 500-600pF, which might be too low but still works.
